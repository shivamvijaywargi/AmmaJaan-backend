## Tech Stack

**Client:** Not sure yetðŸ˜¢

**Server:** NodeJS, ExpressJS, TypeScript, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT

PS: For complete list of packages check out package.jsonðŸ˜‰

## Features

- AUTH - Register, Login, Logout, Forgot Password, Reset Password
- USER - Get user, update user, delete user, upload avatars
- PRODUCT - Create, get all, get single, update, delete product(s)
- Uses Refresh Token + Access Token mechanism for relatively better security

## API Reference - Only single example since I cannot write all hereðŸ˜…

#### Get all products

```http
  GET /api/v1/products
```

#### Get single product

```http
  GET /api/products/${id}
```

| Parameter | Type               | Description                          |
| :-------- | :----------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| `id`      | `string(ObjectId)` | **Required**. Id of product to fetch |

## Demo

I might make a Swagger documentation in the future, if I can learn it sooner.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Coupon

- [ ] Addresses

- [ ] Order

- [ ] Payment integration

- [ ] Review

- [ ] Wishlist

- [ ] Learn testing first and then implement it

## Installation

Install AmmaJaan with yarn (You can choose others as well but I used yarn)

```bash
  # First of all clone the repo
  git clone https://github.com/shivamvijaywargi/full-stack-eCommerce.git
  # Now cd into the cloned repo
  cd full-stack-eCommerce
  # Now to run server cd into server/
  cd server/
  # First we need to install dependencies
  yarn
  # Finally use this command to run the server in dev mode (For other commands check package.json)
  yarn start:dev
```

## Environment Variables

See `contributing.md`(In process) for ways to get started.

Please adhere to this project's `code of conduct`.

## Lessons Learned

### Achieving

- Improved my knowledge on building backend using TS
- Learned about Zod and how to create Zod schemas for validation
- How to create interfaces for mongoose schemas
- First time using formidable and it was a good experience
- Basic API security using express-rate-limit + helmet
- Need something out of built-in fs package, fs-extra is what you needðŸ˜‰
- Create user friendly URLs with Slug (Say **NO** to **63e722d56f4c46aa8c65a82f**)
- Better logging using Winston + Morgan (A level up compared to console logs)
  - PS: Do not block your thread (IFKYK)

### Yet to achieve

There are still a few things I still need to dive into which includes but not limited to

- Docker, ESLint + Prettier, I will try to learn about them first before implementing/using/integrating them in this project
- Use Zod in conjunction with Formidable to be able to create schema to check for fields as well.

## Optimizations

- Used Zod for Schema validation where it was necessary to reduce something like

  ```typescript
  if (!name || !email || ....) {
      return next(new AppErr(...))
  }

  if (name.length < 5) {
      return next(new AppErr(...))
  }
  ```

- Refactored routes to use router.route and chain them instead of router.get, router.post, and so on and so forth

  ```typescript
  router.route('/').post(createProduct).get(getAllProducts);

  router
    .route('/:id')
    .get(getProductById)
    .put(updateProductById)
    .delete(deleteProductById);
  ```
